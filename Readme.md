# üöÄ Blazor Web App with MudBlazor and Northwind DB

Welcome to this Blazor Web App! This project demonstrates how to create a modern Blazor WebAssembly app with a responsive UI powered by **MudBlazor** and connected to a **SQL Server** database (Northwind DB).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Blazor WebAssembly**: A client-side web app framework powered by .NET.
- **MudBlazor**: A Material Design component library for Blazor.
- **Northwind DB**: A popular demo database for learning SQL and database management.
- **SQL Server**: The back-end database that holds the Northwind data.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need the following tools and software:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with **Blazor WebAssembly** and **SQL Server** components)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) library installed via NuGet
- The [Northwind Database](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs) installed in SQL Server

## üìù Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilsao/Northwind.git
cd Northwind
```
### 2. Set Up Northwind Database

Download Northwind DB: [click here](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs)

Restore Northwind DB in SQL Server: Use the instnwnd.sql script file and execute it on your SQL Server instance.
Update the appsettings.Development.json file with your SQL Server connection string.
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "NorthwindConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=Northwind;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;Integrated Security=True;Trust Server Certificate=True;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"
  }
}
```
### 3. Install MudBlazor or MudBlazor Template

Install MudBlazor using NuGet:
```bash
dotnet add package MudBlazor
```

or Install MudBlazor Templates (Ready to use) using Terminal:

The MudBlazor Templates are based on the Microsoft Web App template but have been modified to include MudBlazor components. 

Open a terminal and install them using this command:
```bash
dotnet new install MudBlazor.Templates
```

### 4. Run the Application

Run the Blazor WebAssembly app using Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code or Rider or the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```

Visit http://localhost:5000 **(your port must be different)** in your browser and explore the application!

## üìä Project Structure

- Pages: Contains all the Blazor pages (UI components).
- Data: Data models and services (e.g., NorthwindService.cs for DB interaction).
- wwwroot: Static files like CSS, JS, and images.
- Shared: Common UI components shared across pages.
- MudBlazor Components: Custom MudBlazor components and styling.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Blazor WebAssembly: Build interactive web apps using C#.
- MudBlazor: A Material Design library for Blazor apps.
- SQL Server: A relational database management system.
- Northwind Database: A sample database for understanding business operations.

## üíª Contribution

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature.
- Commit your changes: git commit -m 'Add new feature'.
- Push to your branch: git push origin feature/your-feature.
- Create a pull request.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

- SQL Server connection issues: Double-check your connection string and make sure SQL Server is running.
- MudBlazor components not loading: Ensure you‚Äôve installed the correct MudBlazor package and added it to _Imports.razor.
